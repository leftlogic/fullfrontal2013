  So maybe you're wondering where the speakers are? Do that matter?
  Certainly I'm not downplaying the important role the speakers play
  and how important they are to me personally, to put on this great
  event we've all come to love. The question remains: who are the
  speakers?

  Well, here's the thing. I've been saying that Full Frontal is
  primarily about the content. So I'm attempting to put my money
  where my mouth is. Full Frontal releases it tickets with the content
  only. You'll have to trust my judgement that the speakersa are
  going to be amazing...but then, when have I let you down?

  The *plan* is, once we've sold out, then I'll switch the mode on
  the site.

  This is an experiment, and if it fails quickly, I'll change my plan
  quickly, but hopefully this comment serves as some form of
  explanation as to what's going on.

  Good luck, and I hope to see you in November.

  - Remy / @rem
